This script scrapes products from aldi.nl website
##################################

In the products.txt file are written the paths to the wanted products.

The syntax functions like the following:
    1. The string before '||' is for clicking the categories in the left panel
    2. The string after '||' is the path to the wanted subcategories

Important:
    1. If you want to add a new path please make sure the names are written correctly
       otherwise there will not be any product to be scraped.
    2. Also the path to the products page needs to be full otherwise 'Nothing found for url' will be printed

To get a better idea what I'm talking about test the script and see that
    1. 'Ovenvers gebakken brood||' is missing the full path to the products page
    2. 'Notenassortimenten||' is incorrectly written as it should be 'Notenassortiment||'

Please don't forget to change the webdriver path at line 71 and mssql connection string
